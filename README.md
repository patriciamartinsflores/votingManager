# Voting Manager

Voting Manager is a Rest API made to manage decisions in a cooperativist organization.

## Features
You can save new associates, save different proposals for voting, initiate a voting session for a specific proposal (you can decide how many seconds it will last), save new votes from associates, and fetch the result from a session when it's voting time is over. 


## Usage

You can import the [Insomnia File](https://github.com/patriciamartinsflores/votingManager/blob/master/Insomnia_2023-12-11.json) to test all endpoints.
